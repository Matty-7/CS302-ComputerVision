    "**a)** Load the person with a camera image (from skimage), convert it to float (range zero to one) and cut it again to 500 by 500 pixels. Then create a second image (again size 500 by 500) of a horizontal sine wave (i.e. the gray values in each column are all identical) of mode 20 and gray values between zero and one. This can be done in a number of ways, one option is to create a row vector with the sinusoidal values and then use np.tile() to expand it into a matrix. Display those two images. Finally create a new image by adding the camera and the sine wave image. Display the combined image. (*1 point*) \n",

    "\n",
    "Then create a regular plot of the absolute value of those Fourier amplitudes which correspond to horizontal waves. This means reading out one row from the Fourier space image. You can keep the x-axis to be the pixel coordinate of the Fourier space image. (If you want to make it mode number, you will need some re-scaling here. Hint: where is mode zero?) (*1 point*) \n",
